# githubstarsearch
Bare bones search for repos on Github in order of most stars to least


I wanted to make this have the least amount of spin up time as possible.  So rather than having multiple directories to worry about, along with a build process.  It seemed simpler to not add more than what's needed.

So what's needed is style, js, and html.  So those are the only 3 files I included.

Limited my time on this to about 3-4 hours, and just jumped in.

You can pull down few files, and just open up the index.html and it's ready to go.


#My Thought Process

Usually things would be split into different directories, or if using React, splitting things by component.

However, since pulling in frameworks was massive overkill, the only real helper I used was Sass.  Otherwise everything is vanilla.

No file is big enough to really warrant making additional files.  Although the JS could have probably been cleaned up a bit by moving some of the html markup into a cleaner function, but even that seemed kind of unnecessary due to the simplicity of the application.



#Additional Notes

Wanted to throw in a little bit just for fun, so included a small transition once you actually search moving the position of the search box, and also added a little bit if any of the repos had over 9000 stars (might have to open that image in another page to really see it well since it's just supposed to be more of an easter egg)

Also, of course it is mobile responsive, because it would just be kind of gross not to.

Lastly, I didn't have a chance to do a ton of hunting for bugs in this, as my time was pretty limited (have a freshly spayed puppy) so there are things I would probably test and most likely improve.
